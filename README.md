gopherjs-demo
=============

Simple demo for how to use
[Gopherjs](http://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) and its associated
[DOM library](http://dominik.honnef.co/go/js/dom) in a way idomatic to
GoLang; specifically, how to wrap the DOM in simple types wired up to
channels and react to them via goroutines in the normal way.

The go source is
[hello.go](http://github.com/malvira/gopherjs-demo/blob/master/hello.go)
and you can try the live demo here:
